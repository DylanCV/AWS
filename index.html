<h3>Today we worked on a group project<hr></h3>

    This is my week 1 blog. In this weeek we talked and learned about engineering class. We also got the syllabus.

    This is my week 2 blog. In this week we learned how to work github and awsacademy. We also played a fun little challenge with marbles. Where we had 10 half cut pvc pipes and had to move the marble all the way to a bucket. The class was split in half and raced to see who could get the marble into the bucket first. The other group got their marble into the bucket first but we soon after got it in too. You had to make it into the bucket twice with two different marbles. My group made the second marble before the other group and won this challange.

    This is my week 3 blog. In this week we finished up our Rube Goldberg tinkercad model and worked on Challenge #3. We also got into our groups to choose which machine we thought was the best. We went with Conner's machine because it looked good and fairly easy to build. In the challenge we drew an E and the measurements we wanted for the E. After we drew the measurements we gave the E to someone next to us. I gave it to the person behind me and he gave me his. I then drew out his E and he drew mine. After you finished drawing then you had to cut it out and turn it in. Mine wasn't perfect but it wasn't bad.

    This is my week 4 blog. In this week we began building our real life Rube Goldberg machine and did Challenge #4. We are almost done with our Rube Goldberg machine we just need to finish our pulley. We built the pillars and I brought the paper towel rolls we are going to use. Next week we will finish it and start testing. For the challenge we had to make a little paper boat and see if it could float for 5 minutes. You could've also added weight to the boats if you wanted. We added 22 grams of weight and our boat floated for the 5 minutes.
